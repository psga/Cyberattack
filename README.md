## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Timeline**: Navigate through decades of history with a smooth, "lerped" horizontal scroll and draggable interface.
- **Categorized Archive**: Explore four critical pillars of cybersecurity:
    - 🔴 **Malware**: Viruses, worms, and ransomware that reshaped the web.
    - 🟠 **Data Breaches**: Landmark cases of massive personal data exposure.
    - 🟣 **Cyberwarfare**: State-sponsored digital sabotage and geopolitical conflicts.
    - 🔵 **Vulnerabilities**: Technical flaws that became turning points for security.
- **Deep-Dive Modals**: Each event features detailed descriptions, high-resolution visuals, and curated internal/external resources.
- **Dynamic Progress Bar**: Real-time visual feedback of your position in history.
- **Filterable View**: Toggle categories to focus on specific types of digital events.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Dark mode "glassmorphism" UI, star-field canvas backgrounds, and smooth micro-animations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and state management.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Visuals**: HSL Canvas API for the interactive star-field background.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is built to be lightweight and zero-dependency (using CDNs).

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyberattack-history.git
   ```
2. **Open the project**:
   Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

No build step or local server is required, though a local development server (like VS Code Live Server) is recommended for the best experience.
